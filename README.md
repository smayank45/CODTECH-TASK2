## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

### PROJECT : BLOCKCHAIN SECURITY AUDIT

### OBJECTIVE
Conduct a security audit of a blockchain network to identify vulnerabilities
and potential attack vectors. Analyze smart contracts, consensus
mechanisms, and network infrastructure for security weaknesses.

## 1. Smart Contracts Analysis:

Smart contracts are typically written in Solidity (for Ethereum) or similar languages, so you might need to use an external library or tool to analyze them.
You can parse smart contracts for known vulnerabilities using static analysis tools or external APIs.

## 2. Consensus Mechanism Analysis:

This involves checking the consensus algorithm (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake) for potential flaws.
You can simulate attacks like the 51% attack to see how the network responds.

## 3. Network Infrastructure Analysis:

Check for DDoS protection, validate the networkâ€™s node communication security, and ensure proper encryption.

## Explanation:

**'analyzeSmartContract(String contract):'** Placeholder for analyzing a smart contract. You would typically use external libraries or APIs to perform this task.

**'analyzeConsensusMechanism():'** Simulates a consensus mechanism analysis.

**'analyzeNetworkInfrastructure(String nodeIP, int port):'** Basic connectivity check for nodes in the network.

**'checkEncryption(String data):'** Demonstrates a simple hashing function, which could be part of the encryption check.
